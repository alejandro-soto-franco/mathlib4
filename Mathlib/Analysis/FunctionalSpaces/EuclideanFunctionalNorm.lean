# The norm of a functional on Euclidean space in standard coordinates

A continuous linear functional `L` on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` has squared norm equal to the
sum of the squares of its values on the standard basis vectors: `‖L‖² = ∑ i, (L (single i 1))²`.
Through the Fréchet-Riesz representation, `L (single i 1)` is the `i`-th coordinate of the Riesz
vector, and the identity is Parseval for that vector.

Applied to `L = fderiv ℝ φ x`, this expresses the squared gradient norm `‖fderiv ℝ φ x‖²` as the
sum of squared partial derivatives `∑ i, (∂ᵢ φ x)²`, the form in which the gradient `L²` norm of
`MeasureTheory.integral_sq_sub_translation_le` meets a Sobolev `H¹` gradient bound.
